# Wind-Turbine-High-Speed-Bearing-Prognosis

High-speed bearings play a vital role in the functionality of modern wind turbines. Accurately estimating impending failure and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings brings significant benefits in scheduling maintenance strategies and preventing sudden turbine shutdowns. This paper discusses a reliability enhancement prognosis framework for high-speed wind turbine bearings based on a measured representative vibration signature. A health indicator is constructed using a sliding window adaptive threshold (SWAT) to map the degradation behavior of the bearings into RUL. The Gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based deep learning algorithm shows promising predictive performance in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and relative accuracy (RA).
